Original description
--------------------

To my surprise I could not find a syntax file for 8051 assembly.  So I started with vimscript#966 (which was apparently derived from the asm68k syntax) and derived this syntax file.

The assembler directives and such are IAR specific b/c that is the toolset that I am currently using.  Feel free to expand with support for Keil and/or SDCC.


My improve
-----------

I add support of inline assembler in C source. This is for sdcc compiler.
